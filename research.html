        <h2>Turbulence research</h2>
        <p>I use highly parallelizable direct numerical simulation codes (see below) to investigate fundamental questions of turbulence behavior. Specifically I am very interested on unsteadily driven flows, transition to turbulence and the effect uncertainties have on turbulence predictability and controllability. My work also focuses on turbulence modelling, and the use of data driven methods to unveil fundamental turbulence mechanisms.

        <h2>Multiphysics problems</h2>
        <p>
          I am deeply involved in research projects of fluid-fluid interactions, and fluid-solid interactions. In particular, I investigate drop and bubble breakup in turbulent flows, and the fluid structure interaction in the flow inside elastic pipes (as a model of cardiovascular flows). I am also quite interested on other fluid structure interaction problems related to biological flows like flapping wings.

        <h2>Development of GPU DNS codes</h2>
        <p>
          As part of my research activity I really enjoy coding. I have produced a series of DNS codes of canonical flows based on GPU-CUDA that are highly parallelizable, and are extremely cost-efficient. I currently maintain codes for  pipe flow (<a href="https://github.com/Mordered/nsPipe-GPU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publicly available here
  </a>) natural convection, channel and Kolmogorov flow. This last three are not yet public, but I am happy to share them with you if you are interested on them.
